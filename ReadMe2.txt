There are two environments in this repository:
1. env - Used for running the program in my personal computer
2. venv - Used for running the program in my office computer

There are two backend folders. These backend folders are where the APIs are located.
1. backend - This is the latest version of the API. Bugs are fixed
2. backend(old) - This is the old version that has bugs


There are to frontend folders. These frontend folders are where the GUI files are located.
1. frontend - This is the latest GUI of the program. Bugs are fixed
2. frontend(old) - This is old GUI version of the program. It has bugs and lacking in UI/UX features

The "Runnable Warehouse Program EXE" folder is where the executable program is located.
All subfiles and subfolders inside this folder are all important to run the Warehouse Program. 



The program is currently using the "backend" and "frontend" folder to run it. In addition, the "backend(old)" and "frontend(old)" folders were not used but are still important for restoring the previous features of the system.
